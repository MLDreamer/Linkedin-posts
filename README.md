This repository contains code for creating engaging, visually appealing data science content for LinkedIn. The code generates informative animations and visualizations that illustrate key concepts in time series forecasting.

Features

Interactive animations that visually demonstrate how different forecasting models work
Comparison of model performance using RMSE and other metrics
Clean, LinkedIn-optimized visualizations that stand out in the feed
Code that's easy to customize for your own data and forecasting needs

Usage
Prerequisites
bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels tensorflow
Running the code

Clone this repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-data-science-posts.git
cd linkedin-data-science-posts

Run the code in your environment or Google Colab:

pythonpython exponential_smoothing.py
# OR
python arima_vs_lstm.py

The code will generate:

An animated GIF showing the model comparison
